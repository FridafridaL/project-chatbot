# Project Name

Chatbot
The task is to make a chatbot with some questions and answers between bot and user.

## The problem

I've been using notion, stack overflow, google and chatGPT.
I think this was really hard understanding functions and how everything relates.

If I had more time I whould like to make the chat longer. Also there are some things I like to do for example didn't the test i showmessage change when I targeted the function again. I also wanted the buttons to not be in the chat.
If I had more time I also wanted pictures for each animal in the animal info.
